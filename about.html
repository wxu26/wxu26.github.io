            <p>I am currently a researcher at Anthropic. I try to understand the inner workings of large language models and use that knowledge to build more interpretable models. I also believe that understanding how large language models "think" could help us understand how the human brain thinks.</p>
            <p>Before this, I spent a decade in astrophysics. I started doing astrophysics research with Prof. Dong Lai during my undergraduate at Cornell. I then moved to Princeton and completed my PhD in 2022 with Prof. Matthew Kunz. After that, I did a 3-year postdoctral fellowship at the Flatiron Institute.</p>
            <p>As an astrophysicist, I mostly work on planet formation, with the goal of developing a minimal ab-initio theory that can quantitativly predict the basic outcomes of planet formation. My work spans nearly all stages of planet formation, and range from numerical simulations to observational tests. Beyond planet formation, I am generally interested in developing simple theoretical explanations for complex dynamical systems - this includes, for example, the hot accretion flows around supermassive black holes. You can view a full list of my astro publications here.</p>
            <p>I had a lot of fun working on projects that I deem worthy to be put in future textbooks. But over the years, I grew a little disappointed as I found it difficult to convince the astro community to think about broader impact when there is no job security and everyone is exhuausted just to survive. (I think it is fundamentally a problem with how the field is funded. Quite ironically, what eventually drove me out of the field was a wave of hiring freeze prompted by funding cuts.)</p>
            <p>All this experience makes me think a lot about how scientific fields should be defined (or redefined) and how scientific research (and researchers) should interact with the society. That's why I sometimes write about these topics.</p>
