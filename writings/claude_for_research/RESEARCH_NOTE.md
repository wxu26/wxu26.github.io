# [Project Title]

## Preamble: Guidelines for These Notes

*Read this section whenever updating.*

### What These Notes Should Be

Treat this as a publishable research paper, except:

- **Uncertainty is explicit** — use markers (`[HYPOTHESIS]`, `[PRELIMINARY]`, `[SOLID]`), not hedging prose
- **Gaps are visible** — mark them (`[BLOCKING]`, `[FUTURE]`), don't smooth over
- **Sections can be unbalanced** — developed where we have results, skeletal where we don't
- **Abandoned paths are documented** — in appendix, not omitted
- **Structure is provisional** — may need revision as understanding evolves

**A good research note = a publishable paper with explicit, fully-enumerated holes.**

### Bidirectional Criterion

- **Forward:** Every marker, if resolved, should advance the paper
- **Backward:** Every loose end should be captured by a marker

If you see an unmarked gap, add a marker. If a marker wouldn't help when resolved, remove it.

### Update Guidelines

- **Extend existing sections** by default; new sections fragment the narrative
- **Add new section** only when content is genuinely a new thread (would be a paper section)
- **Revise in place** when information changes; don't append "UPDATE: actually..."
- **Prune to appendix** when abandoning an approach; don't delete, move
- **Restructure** when the narrative no longer fits; flag it, don't do silently

### Anti-patterns

- Smoothing gaps with hedging language instead of marking
- Hiding uncertainty to make it "read better"
- Balancing sections artificially
- Inserting at top of documents/sections
- Creating new section for every thought
- Orphaned content that doesn't connect to narrative
- Premature polishing before content is settled
