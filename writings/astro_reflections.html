            id="reflections-on-the-astrophysics-narrative">Reflections
            on the Astrophysics Narrative</h1>
            <p>Created: January 18, 2026</p>
                        <h2 id="why-im-writing-this">Why I’m writing this</h2>
            <p>The field of astrophysics is not in great shape. The
            problems are well known: too many PhDs, not enough faculty
            jobs, tight funding. The quality of life that an academic
            career offers is, frankly, worse than what people with
            similar abilities could find in industry. Some complain that
            success depends less on the quality of your work than on
            salesmanship, connections, and alignment with big
            programs.</p>
            <p>I don’t want to rehash these issues. People still in
            academia are better positioned to discuss the immediate
            questions. Instead, I want to step back and reflect upon
            some higher-level questions:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>How does this field actually operate, and what value
            does it create?</li>
            <li>What makes a once-thriving field lose its momentum—or
            shift direction?</li>
            <li>How might theoretical astrophysics reinvent itself if it
            wants to thrive in the coming decades?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>My interest in these questions is driven by my own
            experience as a former astrophysicist. It started with the
            simple desire to better articulate how my research fits into
            the field’s bigger picture, intensified when the ability to
            form a narrative of myself pushing the field forward became
            the crucial element of getting a faculty job, and eventually
            mellowed into a more distant reflection driven by general
            curiosity after I left the field. My perspective has evolved
            a lot across this journey, and synthesizing all these
            perspectives offers an interesting sketch of the system that
            may or may not be accurate.</p>
            <p>For those outside the field, I hope this is an
            entertaining story; for those inside, I hope this encourages
            you to reflect on these questions yourself.</p>
                        <h2 id="how-the-field-operates-an-economic-perspective">How
            the field operates: an economic perspective</h2>
            <p>Before getting into what’s wrong, it helps to understand
            how astrophysics sustains itself. I find it useful to think
            of it as an exchange between the field and society.</p>
            <p>Astrophysics runs mostly on public money—in the US,
            primarily NASA and NSF grants. So the field’s survival
            depends on <a
            href="https://aas.org/advocacy/how-aas-advocates/congressional-visits-days">convincing
            the government</a> that it is delivering sufficient value to
            society to deserve the taxpayer money it burns.</p>
            <p>That value comes in two flavors. There’s
            concrete value: training scientists and engineers,
            educating students, producing new knowledge and
            technological spinoffs with broad impact. And there’s
            emotional value: national pride, the satisfaction
            of human curiosity, the sense that we’re part of a species
            that reaches beyond itself. Those gorgeous telescope images
            online have real value, even if it’s hard to quantify.</p>
                        <h2 id="why-were-in-trouble">Why we’re in trouble</h2>
            <h3
            id="the-concrete-value-has-weakened-over-the-past-half-century">The
            concrete value has weakened over the past half-century</h3>
            <p><strong>Technological spinoffs are no longer our
            strength.</strong> During the Apollo era, space programs
            drove genuine engineering progress. The missions demanded
            advances in computing, materials, precision manufacturing.
            By 1963, Apollo was consuming 60% of America’s integrated
            circuit production, helping accelerate the silicon
            revolution by perhaps a decade. The benefits cascaded
            through the whole economy.</p>
            <p>That’s no longer true. Today, the cutting edge of
            computing is driven by AI companies, not space telescopes or
            astrophysical simulations. Astronomy still uses
            these technologies, but we no longer drive their
            development. The spinoff argument, once a major
            justification for funding, has become less convincing.</p>
            <p><strong>The big questions are “answered enough.”</strong>
            This one is subtler but maybe more important.</p>
            <p>Consider how much was genuinely unknown a century ago. In
            1920, astronomers <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy)">held
            a formal debate</a> about whether the Milky Way was the
            entire universe or just one galaxy among many—the answer
            wasn’t obvious. Through the 1950s, respected scientists <a
            href="https://history.aip.org/exhibits/cosmology/ideas/bigbang.htm">argued</a>
            that the universe might be eternal and unchanging, with no
            beginning at all; the Big Bang wasn’t settled until the
            cosmic microwave background was discovered in the mid-1960s.
            The <a
            href="https://www.mos.org/article/exoplanet-anniversary-30-years-discovery-51-pegasi-b">first
            planet outside our solar system</a> wasn’t confirmed until
            1995. These weren’t esoteric puzzles. They were questions
            about whether we’re alone, whether everything had a
            beginning, whether our cosmic neighborhood is typical or
            special.</p>
            <p>Today, those error bars have narrowed. Not because we’ve
            solved everything—plenty of mysteries remain—but because
            we’ve learned enough that laypeople no longer need to update
            their worldview every decade. The progress we make now is
            incremental: a few years ago we knew of about 5,000
            exoplanets, now we know of over 6,000. That’s a great step
            for the field, but it doesn’t change how ordinary people
            understand their place in the universe. We’re no longer
            generating knowledge that all educated people feel they
            should know.</p>
            <h3 id="so-the-field-leans-on-the-emotional-pillar">So the
            field leans on the emotional pillar</h3>
            <p>With the concrete value weakening, the emotional side has
            become the main pillar holding everything up. Wonder.
            Inspiration. The dream of becoming a scientist. National
            pride.</p>
            <p>And this still works. James Webb Space Telescope images
            go viral. Kids still dream of studying black holes. The
            public genuinely enjoys the spectacle of cosmic discovery,
            even if it doesn’t affect their daily lives.</p>
            <p>Since this is now the field’s primary source of
            legitimacy, we invest heavily in it. Outreach programs.
            Research opportunities for undergraduates. A pervasive
            narrative that science is exciting and accessible, that
            you could be a scientist.</p>
            <h3 id="a-tension-between-narrative-and-reality">A tension
            between narrative and reality</h3>
            <p>Providing emotional value comes with some subtle but
            important cost. To sustain the emotional pillar, we need to
            advertise that working in this field is interesting,
            rewarding, and impactful, and broadly accessible. This
            creates a tension with the reality that funding only allows
            a small fraction of people to take astronomy as a lifelong
            career.</p>
            <p>On the one hand, we have done a great job in publicity
            and as a result we keep attracting bright young people. (The
            eager undergrads in our labs, enthusiastic grad students at
            our telescopes, fresh faces to put in front of Congress also
            contribute to the public image of the field.) On the other
            hand, we can’t absorb all these people. The jobs don’t
            exist.</p>
            <p>Within the field, people are now fairly transparent about
            the grim job prospects—but this often comes late. So we end
            up with a mismatch between expectations and outcomes.
            Students enter imagining they’ll do groundbreaking research
            and build a career. By the time they understand the odds,
            they’re deep in—with a PhD nearly complete, skills highly
            specialized, and options narrower than when they
            started.</p>
            <p>This, I think, is the deeper reason behind the job market
            imbalance. It’s not just supply and demand. It’s a
            structural mismatch between the narrative that attracts
            people in and the reality that awaits them.</p>
            <h3 id="no-clear-standard">No clear standard</h3>
            <p>One more consequence of this tension between narrative
            and reality: the field cannot reach a coherent standard for
            what “good work” means.</p>
            <p>There’s a tension between what the field actually
            does—produce specialized, often esoteric knowledge—and how
            it gets justified to the outside world—as inspiring,
            important, transformative. Different people resolve this
            tension differently.</p>
            <p>Some senior researchers genuinely believe their work has
            intrinsic value: rigorous knowledge, careful theory,
            contributions that will last. They’re not wrong. But others
            emphasize different things: public engagement, connection to
            big collaborative projects, alignment with whatever’s hot
            (AI, new telescopes, <a
            href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15213">alien
            spaceships</a>). These aren’t cynical positions—they’re
            sincere beliefs about what the field is for.</p>
            <p>Because these views conflict, and because there’s no
            external arbiter to settle the question, we end up with no
            coherent standard for what makes a researcher “good.” The
            closest thing to a common currency is fundability—but most
            people find that unsatisfying as a measure of worth.</p>
            <p>The result: students and postdocs struggle to gauge how
            competitive they are on the job market, what they should
            work on, and whether they should stay or leave. Planning
            becomes guesswork. The environment is harder to navigate
            than it needs to be.</p>
                        <h2 id="can-we-rebrand">Can we rebrand?</h2>
            <p>Is there a way out? I want to sketch one possibility—not
            the answer, but an answer that appeals to me. It’s
            biased by my own temperament as a theorist and my desire to
            have the field leaving something lasting behind.</p>
            <h3
            id="the-proposal-theoretical-astrophysics-as-a-methodology-laboratory">The
            proposal: theoretical astrophysics as a methodology
            laboratory</h3>
            <p>Here’s the idea: theoretical astrophysics could position
            itself not just as a source of astronomical knowledge, but
            as a laboratory for developing methods to study complex
            systems—methods that might eventually transfer to
            fields closer to human concerns, like economics,
            neuroscience, or sociology.</p>
            <p>But why?</p>
            <p>First of all, we already resemble these fields. We study
            systems where behavior emerges from complex
            interactions—planet formation, galaxy evolution, stellar
            dynamics. We are similarly limited in the ability to do
            controlled experiments: you can’t manipulate a star’s
            brightness any more than a nation’s interest rates.</p>
            <p>More importantly, astrophysics has two advantages over
            fields that study human systems directly.</p>
            <p><strong>The stakes of being wrong are low</strong>. The stakes of
            <a
            href="https://www.astronomy.com/science/new-study-revisits-signs-of-life-on-k2-18-b/">misidentifying
            a molecule on a distant planet</a> are simply not the same
            as the stakes of getting monetary policy wrong. We can
            afford to try things, fail, and learn.</p>
            <p><strong>The empirical base keeps growing</strong>. New
            telescopes, new surveys, new data. Over long time horizons,
            we have plenty of opportunities to test whether the methods
            we develop actually work. The universe is patient; it will
            keep providing evidence.</p>
            <p>And this isn’t new. The Copernican revolution fills
            history of science textbooks not for the orbital mechanics,
            but for what it taught about evidence and theory change.
            Someday, 21st century astrophysics might be remembered the
            same way—for what it taught about comparing incompatible
            theories and quantifying uncertainty.</p>
            <p>This is, of course, aspirational. None of it has happened
            yet.</p>
            <h3 id="my-experiment-with-mixed-results">My experiment with
            mixed results</h3>
            <p>Toward the later stages of my career, I began steering
            both my research and the narrative around it in this
            direction. I worked on theories of planet
            formation—specifically, how planetary systems emerge from
            the complex dynamics of protoplanetary disks. I tried to
            formulate testable predictions, develop statistically robust
            methods for comparing models, and frame the whole enterprise
            as an exercise in understanding emergent behavior in complex
            systems.</p>
            <p>Some of it worked. The narrative resonated: I got strong
            interest from people outside my immediate subfield, which is
            rare these days. I did fairly well in the 2025 faculty job
            market (until the funding cuts arrived), and a committee
            member called my talk “the best job talk I’ve ever
            heard.”</p>
            <p>So there’s evidence that this framing can land. Interest,
            engagement, even some success. But interest does not always
            translate to investment. The core weakness of this proposal
            is that it does not respect the current economic
            reality.</p>
            <p>This rebranding requires a narrative shift that is hard
            to achieve. That’s not just because people are stubborn.
            (Some are—but I don’t see that as the bottleneck.)
            Fundamentally, it has to do with the funding story: NASA and
            NSF take money from Congress and give to us, and their best
            course of action (to maximize funding success) is to
            formulate a cohesive agenda to convince Congress and
            prioritize funding programs that align with this agenda.
            Thus any change in narrative needs to be coordinated and
            top-down, not spontaneous and bottom-up.</p>
            <p>There’s also a deeper tension with what sustains the
            emotional pillar. For publicity, the best work is work
            that's surprising—bizarre results, new mysteries,
            dramatic overturnings of old ideas. The public wants to
            wonder, not to hear that astronomy is making small,
            methodical progress where each step involves a tiny
            shrinkage of some Bayesian posterior. The romanticism of
            surprise discovery fundamentally contradicts the statistical
            reality that correct error bars literally means that
            everything needs to be unsurprising most of the time.</p>
            <p>In summary, I have mixed feelings about this proposal. I
            think if one or a few really capable people push on this for
            a long time—while maintaining enough traditional impact to
            secure funding and reputation—it might work. But I don’t
            think it will happen spontaneously through some collective
            gradual shift. Economics doesn’t point that way. Still, I
            wanted to articulate it, because it’s the future I would
            have wanted to build.</p>
                        <h2 id="other-possibilities">Other possibilities</h2>
            <p>The rebranding I described in the previous section is
            just one path heavily biased by my own preference for
            reliable error bars and lasting knowledge. There are other
            futures for the field, and I want to sketch a few of
            them.</p>
            <h3 id="the-path-of-least-resistance">The path of least
            resistance</h3>
            <p>There’s a version of the future where almost nothing
            needs to change deliberately, because the field naturally
            evolves toward what it’s paid for.</p>
            <p>In this future, astrophysics leans fully into its
            strengths as a source of public amazement and scientific
            education. Researchers become excellent at connecting their
            work to whatever’s exciting—new space telescopes, AI,
            supercomputers, the search for life. The field cultivates
            outreach, showmanship, and the ability to inspire the next
            generation.</p>
            <p>This isn’t a bad outcome. Even if the research itself
            carries less long-lasting impact, there’s genuine value in
            propagating physical knowledge and scientific curiosity at
            high volume. Education and outreach matter. Inspiring young
            people to pursue science and engineering—even if most of
            them end up in other fields—is a real contribution to
            society. The field doesn’t need to produce revolutionary
            discoveries to justify its existence if it’s doing this
            well.</p>
            <p>What would make this path healthier is coherence and
            transparency. Right now, there’s a mismatch between how
            the field presents itself (as a place where you can have a
            career doing cutting-edge research) and the reality (that
            the number of full-time researchers is ultimately
            constrained by funding, and most people will need to leave).
            If the field developed a more explicit, shared
            narrative—both for junior and senior people—about what it
            actually contributes to society and what career paths
            realistically look like, people would be much better off.
            Less false hope, less quiet despair, more informed
            decisions.</p>
            <p>Market forces will push the field in this direction
            whether or not anyone coordinates it. The question is
            whether we accompany that drift with coherence and
            transparency or let people keep stumbling into a system they
            don’t understand.</p>
            <h3 id="other-paths">Other paths</h3>
            <p>There are other possibilities worth mentioning
            briefly:</p>
            <p><strong>The “true scientist” path.</strong> Work on whatever
            amazes and interests you. Follow your curiosity. I see this
            in many scientists that I respect. But the key is in
            realizing that you’re treating research as something closer
            to a personal calling—work you do because it matters to you,
            not because it’s guaranteed to benefit society in any
            measurable way. And as a result, a taxpayer-funded career
            isn’t something a good researcher “deserves”.</p>
            <p><strong>The engineering path.</strong> Astrophysics could lean
            into its connections with instrumentation, statistics, and
            compute. Less about knowledge, more about building
            things—telescopes, satellites, pipelines for massive
            datasets. This is already happening in parts of the field,
            with the caveat that it is challenging to compete against
            major tech companies in these fronts.</p>
            <p><strong>The artist path.</strong> Astronomy has always produced
            extraordinary images and stories. Maybe the field’s future
            is closer to nature photography or documentary
            filmmaking—valued primarily for aesthetic and emotional
            impact.</p>
            <h3 id="the-bottom-line">The bottom line</h3>
            <p>Any of these futures could be bright. Any of these paths
            could create a field with happy people who stay and equally
            happy people who leave for other careers.</p>
            <p>What they share—and what the field lacks right now—is a
            coherent narrative that everyone is aware of. Not
            necessarily a narrative everyone agrees with, but one that’s
            explicit enough that people can see it, evaluate it, and
            decide whether to embrace it, push for change, or walk away.
            Right now, the field runs on several half-articulated
            stories at once, and the confusion costs us: in wasted
            years, in mismatched expectations, in people optimizing for
            games they didn’t know they were playing.</p>
                        <h2 id="to-my-academia-friends">To my academia friends</h2>
            <p>It’s been a decade from when I started doing astrophysics
            research, to my recent departure from the field. Overall I
            find myself being very fortunate throughout my career, and I
            mostly made good choices (at least by my standard). If
            there’s one thing I regret about my career in astrophysics,
            it’s not doing these reflections earlier. I don’t think it
            would have changed my trajectory—I probably would have made
            the same choices. But it would have improved my mental
            health greatly throughout the journey. There’s a difference
            between being buffeted by forces you don’t understand and
            navigating forces you can at least see clearly.</p>
            <p>Most of us entered the field almost by chance. At a lunch
            table during a conference recently, I asked a few colleagues
            how they ended up in astrophysics. The ubiquitous answer, in
            a small and unscientific sample of five: “I wanted to do
            research, and the astro professors were the first to respond
            to my email.” That’s how I ended up here too. Not because of
            a grand vision, but because someone said yes.</p>
            <p>There’s nothing wrong with that. But it means most of us
            never developed a clear picture of how the field
            operates—what sustains it, what it values, where it’s
            heading. We learned to do research, but not to see the
            system we were part of. And by the time the system’s
            pressures become impossible to ignore, we’re deep in it,
            with years invested and few obvious exits.</p>
            <p>I have no desire to encourage anyone to stay or leave.
            What the world offers each of us, and what each of us wants,
            are all so different. There’s no universal answer. I just
            hope others start asking these questions earlier than I
            did.</p>
