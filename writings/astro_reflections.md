# Reflections on the Astrophysics Narrative

---

## Why I'm writing this

The field of astrophysics is not in great shape. The problems are well known: too many PhDs, not enough faculty jobs, tight funding. The quality of life that an academic career offers is, frankly, worse than what people with similar abilities could find in industry. Some complain that success depends less on the quality of your work than on salesmanship, connections, and alignment with big programs.

I don't want to rehash these issues. People still in academia are better positioned to discuss the immediate questions. Instead, I want to step back and reflect upon some higher-level questions:

- How does this field actually operate, and what value does it create?
- What makes a once-thriving field lose its momentum—or shift direction?
- How might theoretical astrophysics reinvent itself if it wants to thrive in the coming decades?

My interest in these questions is driven by my own experience as a former astrophysicist. It started with the simple desire to better articulate how my research fits into the field's bigger picture, intensified when the ability to form a narrative of myself pushing the field forward became the crucial element of getting a faculty job, and eventually mellowed into a more distant reflection driven by general curiosity after I left the field. My perspective has evolved a lot across this journey, and synthesizing all these perspectives offers an interesting sketch of the system that may or may not be accurate.

For those outside the field, I hope this is an entertaining story; for those inside, I hope this encourages you to reflect on these questions yourself.

## How the field operates: an economic perspective

Before getting into what's wrong, it helps to understand how astrophysics sustains itself. I find it useful to think of it as an exchange between the field and society.

Astrophysics runs mostly on public money—in the US, primarily NASA and NSF grants. So the field's survival depends on [convincing the government](https://aas.org/advocacy/how-aas-advocates/congressional-visits-days) that it is delivering sufficient value to society to deserve the taxpayer money it burns.

That value comes in two flavors. There's *concrete* value: training scientists and engineers, educating students, producing new knowledge and technological spinoffs with broad impact. And there's *emotional* value: national pride, the satisfaction of human curiosity, the sense that we're part of a species that reaches beyond itself. Those gorgeous telescope images online have real value, even if it's hard to quantify.

## Why we're in trouble

### The concrete value has weakened over the past half-century

**Technological spinoffs are no longer our strength.** During the Apollo era, space programs drove genuine engineering progress. The missions demanded advances in computing, materials, precision manufacturing. By 1963, Apollo was consuming 60% of America's integrated circuit production, helping accelerate the silicon revolution by perhaps a decade. The benefits cascaded through the whole economy.

That's no longer true. Today, the cutting edge of computing is driven by AI companies, not space telescopes or astrophysical simulations. Astronomy still *uses* these technologies, but we no longer *drive* their development. The spinoff argument, once a major justification for funding, has become less convincing.

**The big questions are "answered enough."** This one is subtler but maybe more important.

Consider how much was genuinely unknown a century ago. In 1920, astronomers [held a formal debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Debate_(astronomy)) about whether the Milky Way was the entire universe or just one galaxy among many—the answer wasn't obvious. Through the 1950s, respected scientists [argued](https://history.aip.org/exhibits/cosmology/ideas/bigbang.htm) that the universe might be eternal and unchanging, with no beginning at all; the Big Bang wasn't settled until the cosmic microwave background was discovered in the mid-1960s. The [first planet outside our solar system](https://www.mos.org/article/exoplanet-anniversary-30-years-discovery-51-pegasi-b) wasn't confirmed until 1995. These weren't esoteric puzzles. They were questions about whether we're alone, whether everything had a beginning, whether our cosmic neighborhood is typical or special.

Today, those error bars have narrowed. Not because we've solved everything—plenty of mysteries remain—but because we've learned enough that laypeople no longer need to update their worldview every decade. The progress we make now is incremental: a few years ago we knew of about 5,000 exoplanets, now we know of over 6,000. That's a great step for the field, but it doesn't change how ordinary people understand their place in the universe. We're no longer generating knowledge that all educated people feel they should know.

### So the field leans on the emotional pillar

With the concrete value weakening, the emotional side has become the main pillar holding everything up. Wonder. Inspiration. The dream of becoming a scientist. National pride.

And this still works. James Webb Space Telescope images go viral. Kids still dream of studying black holes. The public genuinely enjoys the spectacle of cosmic discovery, even if it doesn't affect their daily lives.

Since this is now the field's primary source of legitimacy, we invest heavily in it. Outreach programs. Research opportunities for undergraduates. A pervasive narrative that science is exciting and accessible, that *you* could be a scientist.

### A tension between narrative and reality

Providing emotional value comes with some subtle but important cost. To sustain the emotional pillar, we need to advertise that working in this field is interesting, rewarding, and impactful, and broadly accessible. This creates a tension with the reality that funding only allows a small fraction of people to take astronomy as a lifelong career.

On the one hand, we have done a great job in publicity and as a result we keep attracting bright young people. (The eager undergrads in our labs, enthusiastic grad students at our telescopes, fresh faces to put in front of Congress also contribute to the public image of the field.) On the other hand, we can't absorb all these people. The jobs don't exist.

Within the field, people are now fairly transparent about the grim job prospects—but this often comes late. So we end up with a mismatch between expectations and outcomes. Students enter imagining they'll do groundbreaking research and build a career. By the time they understand the odds, they're deep in—with a PhD nearly complete, skills highly specialized, and options narrower than when they started.

This, I think, is the deeper reason behind the job market imbalance. It's not just supply and demand. It's a structural mismatch between the narrative that attracts people in and the reality that awaits them.

### No clear standard

One more consequence of this tension between narrative and reality: the field cannot reach a coherent standard for what "good work" means.

There's a tension between what the field actually does—produce specialized, often esoteric knowledge—and how it gets justified to the outside world—as inspiring, important, transformative. Different people resolve this tension differently.

Some senior researchers genuinely believe their work has intrinsic value: rigorous knowledge, careful theory, contributions that will last. They're not wrong. But others emphasize different things: public engagement, connection to big collaborative projects, alignment with whatever's hot (AI, new telescopes, [alien spaceships](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.15213)). These aren't cynical positions—they're sincere beliefs about what the field is for.

Because these views conflict, and because there's no external arbiter to settle the question, we end up with no coherent standard for what makes a researcher "good." The closest thing to a common currency is fundability—but most people find that unsatisfying as a measure of worth.

The result: students and postdocs struggle to gauge how competitive they are on the job market, what they should work on, and whether they should stay or leave. Planning becomes guesswork. The environment is harder to navigate than it needs to be.

## Can we rebrand?

Is there a way out? I want to sketch one possibility—not *the* answer, but an answer that appeals to me. It's biased by my own temperament as a theorist and my desire to have the field leaving something lasting behind.

### The proposal: theoretical astrophysics as a methodology laboratory

Here's the idea: theoretical astrophysics could position itself not just as a source of astronomical knowledge, but as a *laboratory for developing methods to study complex systems*—methods that might eventually transfer to fields closer to human concerns, like economics, neuroscience, or sociology.

But why?

First of all, we already resemble these fields. We study systems where behavior emerges from complex interactions—planet formation, galaxy evolution, stellar dynamics. We are similarly limited in the ability to do controlled experiments: you can't manipulate a star's brightness any more than a nation's interest rates.

More importantly, astrophysics has two advantages over fields that study human systems directly.

*The stakes of being wrong are low*. The stakes of [misidentifying a molecule on a distant planet](https://www.astronomy.com/science/new-study-revisits-signs-of-life-on-k2-18-b/) are simply not the same as the stakes of getting monetary policy wrong. We can afford to try things, fail, and learn.

*The empirical base keeps growing*. New telescopes, new surveys, new data. Over long time horizons, we have plenty of opportunities to test whether the methods we develop actually work. The universe is patient; it will keep providing evidence.

And this isn't new. The Copernican revolution fills history of science textbooks not for the orbital mechanics, but for what it taught about evidence and theory change. Someday, 21st century astrophysics might be remembered the same way—for what it taught about comparing incompatible theories and quantifying uncertainty.

This is, of course, aspirational. None of it has happened yet.

### My experiment with mixed results

Toward the later stages of my career, I began steering both my research and the narrative around it in this direction. I worked on theories of planet formation—specifically, how planetary systems emerge from the complex dynamics of protoplanetary disks. I tried to formulate testable predictions, develop statistically robust methods for comparing models, and frame the whole enterprise as an exercise in understanding emergent behavior in complex systems.

Some of it worked. The narrative resonated: I got strong interest from people outside my immediate subfield, which is rare these days. I did fairly well in the 2025 faculty job market (until the funding cuts arrived), and a committee member called my talk "the best job talk I've ever heard."

So there's evidence that this framing can land. Interest, engagement, even some success. But interest does not always translate to investment. The core weakness of this proposal is that it does not respect the current economic reality.

This rebranding requires a narrative shift that is hard to achieve. That's not just because people are stubborn. (Some are—but I don't see that as the bottleneck.) Fundamentally, it has to do with the funding story: NASA and NSF take money from Congress and give to us, and their best course of action (to maximize funding success) is to formulate a cohesive agenda to convince Congress and prioritize funding programs that align with this agenda. Thus any change in narrative needs to be coordinated and top-down, not spontaneous and bottom-up.

There's also a deeper tension with what sustains the emotional pillar. For publicity, the best work is work that's *surprising*—bizarre results, new mysteries, dramatic overturnings of old ideas. The public wants to wonder, not to hear that astronomy is making small, methodical progress where each step involves a tiny shrinkage of some Bayesian posterior. The romanticism of surprise discovery fundamentally contradicts the statistical reality that correct error bars literally means that everything needs to be unsurprising most of the time.

In summary, I have mixed feelings about this proposal. I think if one or a few really capable people push on this for a long time—while maintaining enough traditional impact to secure funding and reputation—it might work. But I don't think it will happen spontaneously through some collective gradual shift. Economics doesn't point that way. Still, I wanted to articulate it, because it's the future I would have wanted to build.

## Other possibilities

The rebranding I described in the previous section is just one path heavily biased by my own preference for reliable error bars and lasting knowledge. There are other futures for the field, and I want to sketch a few of them.

### The path of least resistance

There's a version of the future where almost nothing needs to change deliberately, because the field naturally evolves toward what it's paid for.

In this future, astrophysics leans fully into its strengths as a source of public amazement and scientific education. Researchers become excellent at connecting their work to whatever's exciting—new space telescopes, AI, supercomputers, the search for life. The field cultivates outreach, showmanship, and the ability to inspire the next generation.

This isn't a bad outcome. Even if the research itself carries less long-lasting impact, there's genuine value in propagating physical knowledge and scientific curiosity at high volume. Education and outreach matter. Inspiring young people to pursue science and engineering—even if most of them end up in other fields—is a real contribution to society. The field doesn't need to produce revolutionary discoveries to justify its existence if it's doing this well.

What would make this path healthier is *coherence and transparency*. Right now, there's a mismatch between how the field presents itself (as a place where you can have a career doing cutting-edge research) and the reality (that the number of full-time researchers is ultimately constrained by funding, and most people will need to leave). If the field developed a more explicit, shared narrative—both for junior and senior people—about what it actually contributes to society and what career paths realistically look like, people would be much better off. Less false hope, less quiet despair, more informed decisions.

Market forces will push the field in this direction whether or not anyone coordinates it. The question is whether we accompany that drift with coherence and transparency or let people keep stumbling into a system they don't understand.

### Other paths

There are other possibilities worth mentioning briefly:

*The "true scientist" path.* Work on whatever amazes and interests you. Follow your curiosity. I see this in many scientists that I respect. But the key is in realizing that you're treating research as something closer to a personal calling—work you do because it matters to you, not because it's guaranteed to benefit society in any measurable way. And as a result, a taxpayer-funded career isn't something a good researcher "deserves".

*The engineering path.* Astrophysics could lean into its connections with instrumentation, statistics, and compute. Less about knowledge, more about building things—telescopes, satellites, pipelines for massive datasets. This is already happening in parts of the field, with the caveat that it is challenging to compete against major tech companies in these fronts.

*The artist path.* Astronomy has always produced extraordinary images and stories. Maybe the field's future is closer to nature photography or documentary filmmaking—valued primarily for aesthetic and emotional impact.

### The bottom line

Any of these futures could be bright. Any of these paths could create a field with happy people who stay and equally happy people who leave for other careers.

What they share—and what the field lacks right now—is a coherent narrative that everyone is aware of. Not necessarily a narrative everyone agrees with, but one that's explicit enough that people can see it, evaluate it, and decide whether to embrace it, push for change, or walk away. Right now, the field runs on several half-articulated stories at once, and the confusion costs us: in wasted years, in mismatched expectations, in people optimizing for games they didn't know they were playing.

## To my academia friends

It's been a decade from when I started doing astrophysics research, to my recent departure from the field. Overall I find myself being very fortunate throughout my career, and I mostly made good choices (at least by my standard). If there's one thing I regret about my career in astrophysics, it's not doing these reflections earlier. I don't think it would have changed my trajectory—I probably would have made the same choices. But it would have improved my mental health greatly throughout the journey. There's a difference between being buffeted by forces you don't understand and navigating forces you can at least see clearly.

Most of us entered the field almost by chance. At a lunch table during a conference recently, I asked a few colleagues how they ended up in astrophysics. The ubiquitous answer, in a small and unscientific sample of five: "I wanted to do research, and the astro professors were the first to respond to my email." That's how I ended up here too. Not because of a grand vision, but because someone said yes.

There's nothing wrong with that. But it means most of us never developed a clear picture of how the field operates—what sustains it, what it values, where it's heading. We learned to do research, but not to see the system we were part of. And by the time the system's pressures become impossible to ignore, we're deep in it, with years invested and few obvious exits.

I have no desire to encourage anyone to stay or leave. What the world offers each of us, and what each of us wants, are all so different. There's no universal answer. I just hope others start asking these questions earlier than I did.
