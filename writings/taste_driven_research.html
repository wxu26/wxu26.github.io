            <h1 id="what-happened-to-research-taste">What Happened to
            Research Taste?</h1>
            <p class="article-date">Created: February 14, 2026</p>
            <p>Something has changed in how research works—or at least
            in how it feels.</p>
            <p>I’ve heard versions of the same unease from theorists
            across fields. The sense that “good taste”—knowing what’s
            worth working on, which directions are promising—matters
            less than it used to. That there’s more randomness in what
            succeeds. That research feels less like navigation and more
            like a lottery, or following a herd.</p>
            <p>Similar frustrations show up online: complaints about
            “publish or perish” pressures favoring safe, incremental
            work over ambitious research; discussions of troubling
            trends in ML scholarship where researchers chase benchmarks
            and bandwagons; laments that choosing good problems is
            rarely taught. The grievances vary, but circle a common
            theme: something about how research directions get chosen
            feels off.</p>
            <p>This article tries to give that feeling shape—a frame for
            what might have shifted, why, and what it might mean.</p>
            <h2
            id="taste-driven-vs.-chance-driven-research">Taste-driven
            vs. chance-driven research</h2>
            <p>Consider two modes of research, idealized as opposite
            poles.</p>
            <p>In <strong>taste-driven research</strong>, you develop a
            sense of what’s missing, what’s ripe, what’s likely to be
            fruitful. You follow that signal. You have some model of the
            field—where the gaps are, where promising peaks might be—and
            navigate toward them. Progress feels like climbing a
            gradient.</p>
            <p>In <strong>chance-driven research</strong>, you pick a
            direction that’s tractable—often based on what methods you
            know, what tools are available, what’s doable—and work on
            it. Sometimes it leads somewhere interesting, sometimes not.
            Progress feels like random walk: explore, and occasionally
            stumble onto something good.</p>
            <p>These are poles on a spectrum. No one does purely
            taste-driven or purely chance-driven research. But the
            balance can shift—for an individual over a career, for a
            field over time, for science as a whole. And the subjective
            sense of many researchers is that we’ve been shifting away
            from taste-driven and toward chance-driven.</p>
            <h2 id="is-this-shift-real">Is this shift real?</h2>
            <p>How much of this is perception, and how much is real
            change?</p>
            <p>I don’t know for sure. One source of ambiguity is that we
            talk about research in a way that systematically favors the
            taste-driven story. Read a paper’s introduction and you’ll
            often find motivated investigation—“we identified this gap,”
            “this question remained open,” “we hypothesized that.”
            Researchers describe their work as guided by what
            <em>should</em> be done, even when it was in fact driven by
            what methods happened to be available. This preference
            shapes how we remember past research too, making it hard to
            know whether things were ever different.</p>
            <p>There’s also a gap between how science is taught and
            practiced. The “scientific method” most of us
            learned—hypothesis first, then experiment, then
            conclusion—presents research as fundamentally taste-driven.
            You identify a question, form a prediction, test it. The
            frame assumes the hard part is knowing what to ask. But
            whether this ever described how research actually worked is
            unclear. It may always have been more ideal than reality.
            (Kuhn made this point decades ago—textbook science
            systematically distorts how discovery happens.)</p>
            <p>So part of the frustration may be this: the way we’re
            taught to think about research doesn’t match how it works,
            and perhaps never did. That dissonance is something many
            feel, even without naming it.</p>
            <p>But I suspect there’s also a real shift—that taste-driven
            research is genuinely losing ground, not just in perception.
            The next section offers a hypothesis for why.</p>
            <h2
            id="why-taste-driven-research-might-be-losing-ground">Why
            taste-driven research might be losing ground</h2>
            <p>My hypothesis: this is less about researchers choosing
            differently and more about what the market selects for.
            Chance-driven research has become more economical, and the
            structural reasons have been accumulating.</p>
            <p><strong>Growing burden of knowledge.</strong> As fields
            mature, developing genuine taste—a calibrated sense of
            what’s important and tractable—requires knowing more. The
            landscape gets larger, more complex. Harder for anyone to
            see clearly enough to navigate well. Meanwhile, random walk
            stays easy: learn what your advisor does, make a random
            variation, see what happens. (This is closer to evolutionary
            algorithm than pure random walk, but both share the same
            spirit—you don’t need the bigger picture.)</p>
            <p><strong>Expanding researcher population.</strong> More
            researchers means more parallel exploration. If each does
            something like random walk, more walkers cover more ground.
            Wider search becomes more efficient than many people working
            the same “correct” direction—especially when no one’s
            confident what correct is.</p>
            <p><strong>Faster communication and feedback loop.</strong>
            Results propagate quickly. Promising directions get noticed
            and amplified. The selection loop tightens: try things,
            publish, see what gets traction, follow the traction. Fast
            iteration beats slow deliberation.</p>
            <p><strong>The field becomes the Bayesian agent.</strong>
            Individual researchers explore semi-arbitrarily. But the
            publication-citation-funding system filters—amplifying what
            works, starving what doesn’t. The taste function has
            migrated from individuals to collective mechanism. The field
            does Bayesian search, even if no individual does.</p>
            <p>This process is self-reinforcing. As collective search
            improves, individual taste becomes harder to compete with.
            You can still develop good judgment through deep study—but
            by the time you develop that judgment, the frontier has
            moved. You’re perpetually catching up. The lag between
            understanding and frontier makes taste-driven work
            increasingly uneconomical.</p>
            <p>One consequence I’d like to highlight: the typical mode
            of theoretical work moves from prediction and guidance
            <em>before</em> new findings to explanation and synthesis
            <em>after</em> them. The theorist becomes less the navigator
            and more the mapmaker who arrives after the territory has
            already been explored.</p>
            <h2 id="is-this-a-bad-thing">Is this a bad thing?</h2>
            <p>It depends on what you’re asking about.</p>
            <p><strong>On the objective side:</strong></p>
            <p>For the field’s progress, the shift is probably
            fine—maybe even beneficial. Collective search may be more
            efficient than individual taste, especially given how hard
            it’s become to see the whole landscape. Understanding still
            gets built, just in different order. The old pattern: theory
            predicts, experiment confirms. The new pattern: experiment
            discovers, theory explains, further experiment refines. The
            endpoint is similar; the path is different.</p>
            <p>Structurally, there may be a real problem, but not the
            one you’d first expect. The issue isn’t that chance-driven
            exploration produces less understanding. It’s that later
            steps, consolidation and theorizing after discovery, may be
            undersupported. Funding and attention concentrate on the
            frontier, the next result. Making sense of what’s already
            found—building maps after territory is explored—gets less
            reward. There’s a related asymmetry: forming explanatory
            theories is cheap, but testing them is expensive. In the old
            theory→verification path, you were forced to put forward
            predictions that could be checked; wrong theories got weeded
            out. But explanatory theories that arrive <em>after</em> the
            data can fit the facts without being truly predictive—and
            wrong theories that still appear to explain something get
            cited anyway. The shift in timing creates a quality-control
            problem.</p>
            <p><strong>On the subjective side:</strong></p>
            <p>For some researchers, yes—something is lost. Some find
            deep satisfaction in identifying good directions: the
            feeling that judgment matters, that you’re navigating not
            wandering, that thinking quality shapes outcome quality.
            When the system shifts toward chance-driven search, this
            satisfaction becomes harder to find. Not because you’re
            doing anything wrong, but because what you valued is less
            rewarded. The connection between taste and outcome weakens.
            Research feels more like lottery, and some don’t like
            lotteries.</p>
            <p>This cuts both ways. Researchers who enjoy stumbling onto
            something unanticipated might thrive. Surprise becomes more
            central. And experimentalists may finally get recognition
            proportional to contribution. The cultural narrative has
            emphasized theoretical insight; the Physics Nobel has
            actually gone roughly 2:1 to experimentalists, but you
            wouldn’t know from how we talk about great science. The
            current shift might correct an old imbalance.</p>
            <h2 id="finding-a-way-out">Finding a way out</h2>
            <p>If you value taste-driven work in this increasingly
            chance-driven landscape, what are the options? Here are a
            few directions I can imagine.</p>
            <p><strong>Go with the current.</strong> Embrace
            exploration. Shift satisfaction from “I identified a good
            direction” to “I explored quickly and stumbled onto
            something interesting.” Learn to enjoy surprises. Accept
            that outcomes are loosely coupled to judgment, and find a
            way to be okay with that. This is probably the most
            practical option for most people. It asks you to change what
            you want, which is hard, but it aligns you with the
            current.</p>
            <p><strong>Try to scale taste.</strong> If chance-driven
            research wins because it parallelizes, maybe taste-driven
            research can also become more competitive. The bottleneck
            for taste-driven work is integration—building a picture
            coherent enough to identify promising directions before
            exploring them. This has traditionally been slow, limited by
            one person’s bandwidth and memory, unable to keep pace with
            the frontier. But AI might change that. LLMs are good at
            gathering and sifting information; paired with a
            researcher’s taste and judgment, they could accelerate
            integration substantially. More generally, increased
            connectivity might also enable better ways to articulate and
            transmit taste and heuristics, or form collaborative taste
            where small groups with complementary knowledge identify
            directions none would see alone. The caveat is that I don’t
            know whether any of this is enough to catch up.</p>
            <p><strong>Treat it as a hobby.</strong> Do taste-driven
            work for intrinsic satisfaction, without expecting it to be
            competitive. Let the field’s efficiency be carried by
            others. Enjoy identifying good directions, building coherent
            pictures, even if not the most efficient path. Many valuable
            activities have become hobbies as they’ve been
            industrialized—woodworking, painting, amateur astronomy.
            Taste-driven research could join that list.</p>
            <h2 id="the-landscape-could-change-again">The landscape
            could change again</h2>
            <p>The current situation isn’t permanent. In particular, AI
            might soon shift the balance unpredictably. AI scales
            strictly better than humans at exploration—equally
            parallelizable, and compute grows faster than researcher
            population. If AI takes over most random walk, humans might
            find comparative advantage shifting toward taste—judgment
            calls, synthesis, “what does this mean” questions. Gradient
            estimation becomes the human contribution, though perhaps a
            small fraction of the whole. Alternatively, AI could get
            good at integration too, and we’ll be forced to accept that
            human research is just a hobby.</p>
            <p>What would it mean to do taste-driven research well in
            this landscape? I’m not sure. The answer probably looks
            different from what most of us were taught.</p>
            <p>Regardless, there’s something to be said for doing
            careful, taste-driven work even when the world doesn’t
            reward it, just like there’s something to be said for
            woodworking in a world of mass-produced furniture. The
            meaning is in the practice itself, not in whether it’s
            economically competitive. Maybe that’s enough. Maybe it
            always was.</p>
