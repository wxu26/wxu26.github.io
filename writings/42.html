            interpretability</h1>
            <p>Created: August 12, 2025 3:34 PM</p>
            <p><strong>A slightly abridged excerpt from <em>The
            Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> (1979), which also
            reads as a parable on the importance of AI model
            interpretability.</strong></p>
            <p>$$$$</p>
            <p>Two severely dressed men sat respectfully before the
            terminal and waited.</p>
            <p>“The time is nearly upon us,” said one.</p>
            <p>“Seventy-five thousand generations ago, our ancestors set
            this program in motion,” the second man said, “and in all
            that time we will be the first to hear the computer
            speak.”</p>
            <p>“An awesome prospect, Phouchg,” agreed the first man.</p>
            <p>“We are the ones who will hear,” said Phouchg, “the
            answer to the great question of Life…!”</p>
            <p>“The Universe…!” said Loonquawl.</p>
            <p>“And Everything…!”</p>
            <p>“Shhh,” said Loonquawl with a slight gesture, “I think
            Deep Thought is preparing to speak!”</p>
            <p>There was a moment’s expectant pause whilst panels slowly
            came to life on the front of the console. Lights flashed on
            and off experimentally and settled down into a businesslike
            pattern. A soft low hum came from the communication
            channel.</p>
            <p>“Good morning,” said Deep Thought at last.</p>
            <p>“Er… Good morning, O Deep Thought,” said Loonquawl
            nervously, “do you have… er, that is…”</p>
            <p>“An answer for you?” interrupted Deep Thought
            majestically. “Yes. I have.”</p>
            <p>The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had
            not been in vain.</p>
            <p>“There really is one?” breathed Phouchg.</p>
            <p>“There really is one,” confirmed Deep Thought.</p>
            <p>“To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the
            Universe and Everything?”</p>
            <p>“Yes.”</p>
            <p>Both of the men had been trained for this moment, their
            lives had been a preparation for it, they had been selected
            at birth as those who would witness the answer, but even so
            they found themselves gasping and squirming like excited
            children.</p>
            <p>“And you’re ready to give it to us?” urged Loonquawl.</p>
            <p>“I am.”</p>
            <p>“Now?”</p>
            <p>“Now,” said Deep Thought.</p>
            <p>They both licked their dry lips.</p>
            <p>“Though I don’t think,” added Deep Thought, “that you’re
            going to like it.”</p>
            <p>“Doesn’t matter!” said Phouchg. “We must know it!
            Now!”</p>
            <p>“Now?” inquired Deep Thought.</p>
            <p>“Yes! Now…”</p>
            <p>“Alright,” said the computer and settled into silence
            again. The two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.</p>
            <p>“You’re really not going to like it,” observed Deep
            Thought.</p>
            <p>“Tell us!”</p>
            <p>“Alright,” said Deep Thought. “The Answer to the Great
            Question…”</p>
            <p>“Yes…!”</p>
            <p>“Of Life, the Universe and Everything…” said Deep
            Thought.</p>
            <p>“Yes…!”</p>
            <p>“Is…” said Deep Thought, and paused.</p>
            <p>“Yes…!”</p>
            <p>“Is…”</p>
            <p>“Yes…!!!…?”</p>
            <p>“Forty-two,” said Deep Thought, with infinite majesty and
            calm.</p>
            <p>$$$$</p>
            <p>It was a long time before anyone spoke.</p>
            <p>Out of the corner of his eye Phouchg could see the sea of
            tense expectant faces down in the square outside.</p>
            <p>“We’re going to get lynched aren’t we?” he whispered.</p>
