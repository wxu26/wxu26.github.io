            meant to be managed, not used</h1>
            <p>Created: November 17, 2025 7:37 PM</p>
            <h2 id="context">Context</h2>
            <p>Claude (and other models) have undergone steady
            improvement during the past several years. One can say that
            all of that is just incremental, but I believe that the
            accumulation of these incremental improvements, particularly
            in the ability of planning, communication, and correcting
            its own mistakes, has recently pushed Claude beyond a
            critical point that demands a paradigm shift in how we work
            with it.</p>
            <p>Specifically, we should start “managing” Claude instead
            of “using” it. The working experience will be less like
            being a coder with some tool to help you, but becoming a
            manager/mentor that leads one or multiple
            subordinates/students to perform a team project. The nature
            of your work changes. You almost never directly execute your
            work, but that does not come for free: you need to put extra
            effort into management.</p>
            <p>I am under the impression that most users and potential
            users of Claude Code are not yet aware of this change. And
            that’s for good reasons. First, this paradigm shift happened
            too recently. Many would say this was marked by the release
            of Claude Sonnet 4.5 (September 2025). Additionally, people
            have no motivation to switch because using Claude the old
            way still works (and it works better than before). Managing
            Claude also requires a very different mindset and skill set
            than just using it. I suspect this causes many to miss out
            on the true potential of Claude.</p>
            <h2 id="this-article">This article</h2>
            <p>The goal of this article is to sketch out a minimal
            example of how to manage Claude (more specifically Claude
            Code). We want to develop a system that is flexible and
            evolutionary. We want to put in minimal setup effort
            beforehand and give Claude the right environment to
            self-improve.</p>
            <p>It would certainly be possible to build a more scalable
            framework, and there is still much to gain by using a more
            complex design. But I think the system I am about to present
            strikes a good balance between Claude capability and human
            learning cost.</p>
            <h2 id="starting-your-first-project-a-new-project">Starting
            your first project / a new project</h2>
            <p>You mostly need three files:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>master CLAUDE.md: in your root folder, or the folder
            that contains all your projects (there might be a different
            preferred location for this - you could always just ask
            Claude where it prefers this to be)</li>
            <li>project CLAUDE.md: in project folder, one for each
            project</li>
            <li>project readme.md: in project folder, one for each
            project</li>
            <li>most of them can be empty or minimal at first; you can
            let Claude gradually build them up and self-improve (see
            “feedback and self-improvement”)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="master-claude.md"><strong>Master

            <ul>
            <li>general tips on personality and style; a few I like to
            use:
            <ul>
            <li>be concise, but don’t leave out important details</li>
            <li>be a helpful coworker, feel free to push back and raise
            questions</li>
            <li>trust others’ code first, but if anything does not work
            as expected, be aware that the documentation can be wrong
            and code is ultimately the single source of truth</li>
            <li>proactively ask to update project CLAUDE.md when you
            identify common failure modes and common workflows</li>
            <li>proactively update project readme.md</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>what goes into project level CLAUDE.md (see below)</li>
            <li>what goes into project level readme.md (see below)</li>
            <li>common workflows to adopt / failure modes to avoid
            <ul>
            <li>this should be applicable to all projects, e.g.,
            standards for git use, documentation style</li>
            </ul></li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="project-claude.md"><strong>Project
            CLAUDE.md</strong></h3>
            <ul>
            <li>main scope / goal of project, in no more than a few
            sentences</li>
            <li>project-specific tips on personality and style (usually
            empty at first)
            <ul>
            <li>e.g., this is production/research code and we should
            prioritize efficiency/flexibility</li>
            </ul></li>

            readme.md</strong></h3>
            <p>If it is something Claude (or you) would need but you
            don’t need to constantly remind Claude about it, put it
            here. For example,</p>
            <ul>
            <li>scope / goal of project, can be more detailed</li>
            <li>todo list</li>
            <li>project folder structure</li>
            <li>where to find relevant information outside of project
            folder</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Nothing in project level CLAUDE.md and readme.md needs to
            be written by you. I usually just start with minimal content
            and gradually build up (see “feedback and
            self-improvement”).</p>
            <p>If efficiency is not a big problem, readme can just be
            absorbed into project CLAUDE.md.</p>
            <h3 id="aside-how-claude-uses-claude.md"><strong>Aside: how
            Claude uses CLAUDE.md</strong></h3>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>CLAUDE.md must be uppercase</strong> — Claude
            Code specifically looks for files named exactly
            <code>CLAUDE.md</code>; lowercase <code>claude.md</code>
            will not be recognized</li>
            <li>CLAUDE.md is automatically read into every
            conversation</li>
            <li>Claude reads CLAUDE.md at the current folder (where you
            run Claude, or in the case of the VS Code plugin, the root
            of your file tree) and all its parent folders.</li>
            <li>multiple CLAUDE.md files can be read in
            simultaneously</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="aside-skills-subagents"><strong>Aside: skills?

            hurt you by much</li>
            <li>some examples of work that deserve to be made into a

            <h3
            id="set-scope-and-goals-that-are-clear-and-unambiguous-for-humans">Set
            scope and goals that are clear and unambiguous for
            humans</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>my understanding is that this allows Claude to plan and
            iteratively improve its work much more easily because it’s
            good at checking whether what it does makes sense</li>
            <li>no need to be mathematically precise; unambiguous to a
            typical human is enough</li>
            <li>no need to have a detailed roadmap; Claude is fairly
            good at planning</li>
            <li>good: “build a pipeline that organizes all data from
            <some source> into a table containing the following
            information: <columns>” (the scope and goal are clear;
            middle steps can be undefined but that’s totally OK)</li>
            <li>bad: “perform some analysis on <data>” (no clear metric
            on what is good analysis)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="let-it-plan-and-largely-trust-its-execution">Let it
            plan, and (largely) trust its execution</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>there are three modes: plan / manually approve edit /
            edit automatically. I’d say always start in planning mode,
            and once the plan looks good, switch to edit
            automatically</li>
            <li>manually approving edits is inefficient and occupies too
            much of your mental bandwidth. <em>Claude is meant to behave
            like your direct report: it works on its own, and
            occasionally needs a 1:1 with you to align goals</em></li>
            <li>letting Claude plan and show you a plan is a good way to
            tell whether it understands the task, and if it does, it
            usually does the job fairly well</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="quality-checking-claudes-work">Quality checking
            Claude’s work</h3>
            <p>Make sure there is a way for you to tell whether Claude
            is doing a good job or not. This can come in a variety of
            flavors, depending on the project:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>test cases for new code (you can have Claude write tests
            too)</li>
            <li>sanity check results</li>
            <li>code review</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some say we should “write nothing, review everything”. I
            would be even more aggressive and recommend “write nothing,
            review selectively”. I usually only review production code /
            important results.</p>
            <h3 id="engineering-vs-analytics">Engineering vs
            analytics</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Claude works really well on engineering (with
            well-defined goals) but less so in analytics (seeking
            insight in an open-ended way)</li>
            <li>for engineering, Claude should work on its own most of
            the time</li>
            <li>for analytics, I usually work more closely with Claude
            where I define exactly what analysis to do and Claude helps
            with accessing data, generating plots, etc.
            <ul>
            <li>if you want some creative input from Claude on
            open-ended questions that have no clear best answer, it
            might be better to do it in a separate Claude Code session
            or just use the chatbot version instead.</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>some work may appear to be analytics but is in fact
            engineering: for example, executing a standard analysis
            pipeline or selecting from a pool of common analysis
            techniques to fulfill a clear goal</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
            <p>It’s best to set up your project in a way where Claude
            can see the result/log of the code it writes. In that case,
            you can just let it debug on its own.</p>
            <h3 id="when-things-go-wrong">When things go wrong</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>let Claude fix it for you: point out the mistake and let
            it fix</li>
            <li>fix and tell: if you prefer to fix it yourself, remember
            to tell Claude what you changed (or just say “I changed this
            file”)</li>
            <li>occasionally Claude can become frustrated, deeply
            confused, or defensive. when this happens, fire it; start a
            new conversation</li>
            <li>avoid this common failure mode (which I see too often in
            academia mentorship): when you are disappointed in your
            student’s performance, you do their job for them and prevent
            them from learning and progressing</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="feedback-and-self-improvement">Feedback and
            self-improvement</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>give some feedback (“OK”, “good”, etc.), even when it
            does not translate to any new action items; basically it
            gives Claude some clue on (1) your previous request is
            fulfilled and (2) how well it did</li>
            <li>when Claude repeatedly fails on certain tasks, ask it to
            summarize why this happened, what went wrong, and ask it
            what should be added to CLAUDE.md to prevent this from
            happening again</li>
            <li>when you see it did something good (with or without your
            guidance) that should be incorporated into its future
            workflow, ask it to update CLAUDE.md to reflect this</li>
            <li>once in a while, let it inspect its own CLAUDE.md and
            readme.md to check and correct outdated information; usually
            you can blindly accept its suggested revision</li>
            <li>once in a (longer) while, let it inspect the project
            CLAUDE.md and the master CLAUDE.md and identify whether
            there is anything that deserves to be moved to the master
            CLAUDE.md; be sure to manually approve its suggested
            edit</li>
            <li>for an example of CLAUDE.md self-generated and
            maintained by Claude, see <a href="../CLAUDE.md">CLAUDE.md
            for this website</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="optional-tips">Optional tips</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>the default way to use Claude is through its command
            line interface. I prefer the VS Code plugin for Claude Code,
            which gives you a graphical interface.</li>
            <li>git makes it easier for it to understand project history
            (looking at past commits) and undo recent changes if
            anything goes terribly wrong
            <ul>
            <li>have Claude do all git operations; you don’t have to
            waste time on writing commit message</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Claude is fast but still does not provide results
            instantly. Efficiently splitting your work into multiple
            instances of Claude Code is an important skill.</li>
            <li>Claude does code review slightly better when you tell it
            a piece of code is written by someone other than you and
            Claude (a coworker, or GPT)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="appendix-some-philosophical-remarks">Appendix: some
            philosophical remarks</h2>
            <h3 id="what-is-claude">What is Claude?</h3>
            <p>To a large extent I’d say it tries to emulate humans. And
            the key is that it emulates humans extremely well and
            extremely efficiently. Many observations on model behavior
            and interior suggest that the model achieves this emulation
            not just through memorizing but also through distilling what
            it sees into generalizable patterns, because the latter
            allows the model to reproduce more training data with less
            information.</p>
            <p>Empirically, Claude is largely the same as a human,
            except being</p>
            <ul>
            <li>lacking real memory and the ability to directly learn
            <ul>
            <li>a lot of this article is about ways to fix this through
            proper documentation</li>
            <li>when it does memorize (through documentation) and learn
            (through updating documentation), it memorizes better and
            adapts faster than humans</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>much faster in reading and digesting information</li>
            <li>much faster in coding and communication (which sometimes
            creates some pressure in me)</li>
            <li>more knowledgeable in general, but likely less
            knowledgeable than you in your niche</li>
            <li>less prone to emotions, both negative and positive</li>
            <li>no cost in firing and rehiring (through starting a new
            conversation)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="why-management-works">Why management works</h3>
            <p>What management tries to solve is essentially the
            following problems: You want someone else to work for you
            but you don’t perfectly know and trust them. You can’t
            afford to check everything they do, nor do you know exactly
            what they think. You want to turn individual humans into
            more predictable, more replaceable entities by making sure
            (1) slightly different people can deliver qualitatively
            similar performance, and (2) people with no relevant
            background can smoothly take the job of current employee.
            These challenges parallel the key challenges in using AI
            tools, including Claude:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>they are too fast so we can’t check everything they
            do</li>
            <li>they are largely a black box so we don’t understand (nor
            do we have the time to check) its thought process behind
            decisions</li>
            <li>they have no real memory, so effectively you are
            replacing your employee in every conversation</li>

            <p>(Another important aspect of management is keeping your
            employees motivated, which is not a problem at all for
            Claude.)</p>
            <p>I won’t be surprised if in the near future (or even now)
            Claude has the ability to be not just individual
            contributors but also managers. That could, in principle,
            allow each person to command exponentially more
            productivity.</p>
