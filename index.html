            <p>I like studying complex systems. There is something deeply satisfying about discovering new dynamics emergent from complexity and distilling complex systems into simple models. I also believe that our ability to conceptualize, predict, and control complex systems lies at the heart of solving some of the most pressing scientific and societal challenges of our time.</p>
            <p>Over the years, my interest in complex systems has led me into two areas of research: astrophysics and machine learning interpretability. I spent the first decade of my career in astrophysics, focusing mainly on planet formation and astrophysical dynamics. You can find a list of my astrophysics papers <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/hSkXBi1xQKqHkrwBRnpD7g">here</a>. While I have left academia, I continue doing some astro research as a hobby.</p>
            <p>Currently, I work as a research scientist at Anthropic, where I focus on interpretability research. I try to build more interpretable large language models through understanding how knowledge is stored in models and used in their "thinking" process.</p>
